Read this file, if you do not understand how to install this LUA script.
Before we install the project, make sure your GTA has the following modifications installed: 

ASI Loader: https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=21709
Moonloader: https://gtaforums.com/topic/890987-moonloader/
CLEO: https://cleo.li/
Sampfuncs: https://gamemodding.com/en/gta-san-andreas/others/76400-sampfuncs-v-541-final.html
(Not all of them are needed, but install them to prevent any nasty issues for my projects in general.)

If you possess all those mods in your GTA, proceed with the following steps:

Note: If you do not possess any external lua script to reload your folder, while ingame,
then close your game for the whole process!

1) Drag the "lib" folder inside "DMGInformer" into your moonloader folder. 
  Replace every file to make sure you possess my library correctly.
  
2) Drag the "resource" folder inside "DMGInformer" into your moonloader folder.  
  Replace every file to make sure you possess my library correctly.
  
2) Place "DMGInformer.lua" inside your moonloader folder.

3) Use your external reloader or restart your game.

4) While ingame, use "damage" as cheatcode to open the GUI.
